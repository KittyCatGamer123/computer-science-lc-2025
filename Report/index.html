        <p class="SectionContent">
            From researching different databases I could use for visualising data on the data.cso.ie<br/>
            website, I came to the decision to focus on data surrounding employment and how other<br/> 
            datasets are affected by the fluctuation of employment levels in the Irish economy.<br/>
            <br/>
            As we all know, COVID-19 took a large hit on the employment rates in Ireland. As shown on<br/> 
            most statistics websites, just like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1360519/employment-rate-ireland/">Statistia</a>, we can see a large drop in employment rates as<br/>
            workers were unable to physically attend their workplaces at this time. For instance, the<br/>
            hospitality, tourism, retail and food service sectors experienced substantial job losses<br/>
            because their operations rely heavily on in-person interactions.<br/>
            <br/>
            According to the <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Indeed-Glassdoor-Workplace-Trends-Report-.pdf">‚ÄúIndeed & Glassdoor Hiring and Workplace Trends Report‚Äù</a> for 2023,<br/>
            it states that:<br/>
            <span style="margin-left:50px">‚ÄúCOVID didn't reverse the long-run demographic trends that will drive tight labor<br/></span>
            <span style="margin-left:50px">markets for the next decade, but it did accelerate changes to the workplace.‚Äù</span><br/>
            <br/>
            Granted, this report is in the global scope of employment and not specifically for Ireland, but<br/>
            it did intrigue me as to how exactly we are coping with the after-effects of COVID almost half<br/>
            a decade later.<br/>
            <br/>
            Additionally, LinkedIn's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2025-15-fastest-growing-roles-0q7kc">‚ÄúJobs on the Rise 2025 in Ireland for 2025‚Äù</a> concludes that the majority of<br/>
            growing jobs currently seem to be physical jobs, such as being a Bus Driver, or Facilities<br/>
            Manager, contrary to a likely belief that it would be jobs that you'd work from home at.<br/>
            <br/>
            With all of this information I've gained, I felt it was worthwhile to at least display the<br/>
            fluctuation of employment over the years to show to people visually how the employment<br/>
            levels are performing, and an opinion on whether the government could or should invest in it<br/>
            can be made by each person individually after seeing such.<br/>
            <br/>
            Prior to deciding this, I also explored datasets on homelessness rates and income and<br/>
            poverty rates. However, the data provided for these topics was not sufficient for the rest of<br/>
            the corresponding data I'd found, as they spanned from 2006 - 2025, and the data<br/>
            for homelessness and income/poverty rates only contained data from Consensuses in 2021,<br/>
            rendering them insufficient for analysis. Other datasets like "Poverty and Deprivation Levels"<br/>
            likewise also were not sufficient because they spanned 2020 - 2024.<br/>
            <br/>
            Being able to visualise data is important, so I found, based on the visualisations from CSO<br/>
            and the software <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, that being able to have data be comprehensible in a simple<br/>
            format is always preferable for the end-user. Tableau was able to provide multiple<br/>
            visualisations on the one dashboard, yet still be formatted in such a way that each element<br/>
            is connected in an understandable manner. I'll be taking inspiration from this layout when I<br/>
            create my interface.<br/>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Section_PlanDesign">
        <h2>üìê Plan and Design</h2>
        <p class="SectionContent">
            The project will be an employment analysis system that collects and visualises employment<br/>
            trends in Ireland, where users will be able to select and filter through data (like by years or<br/>
            gender) to view employment trends. The ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù containing the various graph types<br/>
            that will be created will have data that is <b>cross-referenced together</b>, essentially, comparing<br/>
            employment rates in relation to homelessness rates, to salary rates, hours worked, etc.<br/>
            The use of cross-referencing data is the method I plan to use in order to visualise how<br/>
            employment is interlinked with other elements of Irish society and economy.<br/>
            <br/>
            In order to meet the basic requirements of my project, I plan to use <b>Python</b> to sterilise the<br/>
            data that I will download from the data.cso.ie website as outlined in the brief, and store it in a<br/>
            subfolder so it isn't conflicted with the other source files. To visually display data, I wish to<br/>
            use well-documented libraries such as ‚Äú<b>matplotlib</b>‚Äù in order to create the necessary graphs<br/>
            that fit.  The graphs and information must be encapsulated within a web-based interface,<br/>
            using <b>JavaScript</b>.<br/>
            <br/>
            That being said, web-based content don't directly mix with Python, so in order for the user to<br/>
            directly interact with the graphs and data in real time, and I will be learning how to utilise the<br/>
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a> library in which I can create an API between the interface and the backend content<br/>
            generated by Python. I also will be able to use the <b>Live Server</b> extension onto <b>Visual<br/>
            Studio Code</b> to watch the webpage update in real time for faster debugging. As a means to<br/>
            create a poll for users, the responses will be stored within an CSV file inside the artefact<br/>
            folder which is sent through the same API.

        <h4>Week Six</h4>
        <p><b>Visualisation Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
            <p>
                While implementing the Flask API into the web-based interface, I encountered an issue<br/>
                where the graphs generated by ‚Äúmatplotlib‚Äù were appearing to be broken and display<br/>
                inconsistent data at times upon loading the site, and seeming to fix itself after the user<br/>
                adjusted a parameter. The reason why this is caused is because the library essentially<br/>
                functions as a state machine, meaning all graph generation shares the same global state<br/>
                rather than working independently. When multiple requests came in simultaneously it was<br/>
                attempting to create multiple graphs at once, leading to a race condition where<br/>
                data was written concurrently, and overwriting data over different graphs.<br/>
                <br/>
                Initially, I considered implementing a ‚Äúqueuing system‚Äù to handle this problem by<br/>
                running each request one after the other to prevent visualisations running together. While this<br/>
                seemed to be the most viable approach, it would make the page take much slower to render<br/>
                initially.<br/>
                <br/>
                After researching what I could, I considered multithreading. Beforehand I thought trying to<br/>
                introduce this could end up creating a scope creep on my project, but when I discovered<br/>
                the Python ‚Äúthreading‚Äù library and read samples on it, I realised this issue was incredibly easy to<br/>
                fix. In fact, only a couple lines needed to be adjusted, and suddenly the whole system<br/>
                worked a treat. This meant I was able to prevent race conditions without creating long wait<br/>
                times or unnecessary complexity within my project.<br/>
                <br/>
                Although the fix was so simple, the real challenge I felt was trying to find the correct method<br/>
                of undertaking my problem, specifically on the researching element of finding the correct<br/>
                solution. I was thrilled to find it had worked.<br/>
            </p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="Section_Eval">
        <h2>üïµ Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
            I was successful in achieving both the basic and advanced requirements as outlined in<br/>
            the brief.<br/>
            <br/>
            The dataset, sourced from cso.ie, was extracted, cleaned, and stored using Python, and<br/>
            allowed for the multiple visualisations, such as bar charts and line graphs, to be created,<br/>
            allowing me to complete the first two basic requirements of the project.<br/>
            <br/>
            The interface was developed to make this data accessible to the public, which allows users<br/>
            to interact with visualisations directly on the platform, such as adjusting the Sector or Years<br/>
            ranges for each, both of which complete the last basic and first advanced requirement of the<br/>
            project. Additionally, a user survey was implemented using JavaScript that takes user input<br/>
            and adds it to the user data set, in order to complete the second advanced requirement.<br/>
            <br/>
            Given more time, there are several ways this project could be further improved and<br/>
            expanded. Currently, the data is sourced only from cso.ie, which provides only a limited<br/>
            amount of datasets to view and limited years. With more time, I could expand my sources to<br/>
            other databases, like the ones mentioned in the brief, to be amalgamated together into a<br/>
            larger, more fitting and complete dataset, to carry out more analysis and visualisations on. <br/>
            <br/>
            These databases could also potentially give data surrounding homelessness, data I couldn't<br/>
            find a fitting match for on the cso.ie website, and would make the analysis more insightful by<br/>
            highlighting important social issues that the current dataset lacks.<br/>
