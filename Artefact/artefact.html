            <h4>What are the trends and changes?</h4>
            <p>We can make observations of changes and trends throughout the last two decades linearly based on our data.</p>
            <p style="color:#6A6"><b>> 2008-2014 - Effects of Celtic Tiger</b></p>
            <p>We can see evidence of where the Irish economy fell into a recession as a result of the Celtic Tiger, which affected employment too. Between 2008 and 2014, we can see an extremely large fall in employment levels and earnings. The employment level decreases are shown ubiquitously through the graphs, regardless of sector here.</p>
            <p>To cover some:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mining and Quarrying was making a downward trend around the 2010-2012 era.</li>
                <li>Manufacturing dropped to its lowest point in 2012.</li>
                <li>Construction seriously dropped after 2008, and plummeted around 2012-2013.</li>
                <li>Education was already fairly low, and still went down during this recession.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color:#A5A"><b>> 2020-2022 - Effects of COVID-19</b></p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, the pandemic drastically affected employment rates across Ireland. This is especially evident in the "All NACE Economic Sectors" data in the graphs above, where a sharp drop in employment levels can be seen between 2020 and 2021, reflecting widespread business closures and layoffs during the outbreak.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we can see the opposite effect happen within the "Information and Communication" sector. Due to lockdowns and the shift to remote work, demand for digital services soared. This is proven through the same above graphs, except instead of a decrease we find an increase in this sector during 2020 and 2021.</p>
            <p>To cover some:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wholesale and Retail Trade took a large hit around the beginning when the virus had initially broken out in 2020, before increasing in 2021 and dropping again in 2022.</li>
                <li>Transportation and Storage also took a large dip during 2020-2022, while jumping up in 2021. This could indicate when restrictions were lifted in 2021 before being applied again.</li>
                <li>The Arts and Entertainment, and the Accomodation and Food Services may have been the two sectors affected the most here, plummeting the most during 2021 and 2022. This was likely due to the fact that play and movie theatres had to be closed down due to restrictions to prevent spreading the virus more.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="color:#55A"><b>> 2022-2025 - Post-COVID</b></p>
            <p>Recent data from 2022 onwards shows a steady recovery in employment levels across most sectors, with particular growth in "Professional, Scientific, and Technical Activities" and "Accommodation and Food Services" as tourism and general trading recovers.</p>
            <p>However, we now need to consider a new element: remote work, and the mix of physical and remote working. This has reshaped hiring patterns - rural areas are experiencing a modest boost as more people move away from cities. </p>
            <hr/>

            <h4>What can we do with this information?</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(213, 168, 21)"><b>> Budget for Lesser Performing Sectors</b></p>
            <p>The "Mining and Quarrying" sector, as a primary example, has shown to be very volitile, but is notably overall slowly decreasing over time.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Invest in automation and sustainable mining technologies</b> to boost productivity while reducing operational costs, making the sector less vulnerable to economic fluctuations.</li>
                <li>The government could <b>provide financial support</b>, such as tax cuts or subsidies, to help keep jobs and businesses running throughout large decreases.</li>
                <li>Mining companies should explore other opportunities, like <b>extracting materials for green energy</b>, to stay strong and adaptable.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="color:rgb(21, 120, 213)"><b>> Research Mortgage Interest Trends</b></p>
            <p>A notable trend emerging from the data is the potential decrease in mortgage interest payments. This could significantly impact household spending power, investment patterns, and even employment rates. Lower mortgage payments would leave families with more disposable income, potentially stimulating other sectors like Retail, Tourism, and Entertainment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The government should <b>encourage first-time homeownership</b>. If mortgage rates continue to fall, the government could introduce incentives for newer homeowners, boosting the housing market while supporting sectors tied to homeownership</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="color:rgb(211, 74, 181)"><b>> Consider the Benefits of Remote Working</b></p>
            <p>The high benefit of being able to work remotely is that workers now do not need to commute to their workplaces in order to be present and get work completed. As a side effect of this, it allowed for people who work in rural areas to gain their own salaries too, potentially showing signs of population and economic growth, as according to the Weekly Earnings Trend. Therefore it should be used to our advantage.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Invest in rural infrastructure</b> by providing high-speed internet and better public transport for those in rural areas.</li>
                <li><b>Encourage businesses to allow remote work</b> so that the people in this rural areas have the opportunity to work in the comfort of their home.</li>
            </ol>
