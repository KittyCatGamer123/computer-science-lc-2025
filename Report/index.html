        <p class="SectionContent">
            From researching different databases I could use for visualising data on the data.cso.ie<br/>
            website, I came to the decision to focus on data surrounding employment and how other<br/> 
            datasets are affected by the fluctuation of employment levels in the Irish economy.<br/>
            <br/>
            As we all know, COVID-19 took a large hit on the employment rates in Ireland. As shown on<br/> 
            most statistics websites, just like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1360519/employment-rate-ireland/">Statistia</a>, we can see a large drop in employment rates as<br/>
            workers were unable to physically attend their workplaces at this time. For instance, the<br/>
            hospitality, tourism, retail and food service sectors experienced substantial job losses<br/>
            because their operations rely heavily on in-person interactions.<br/>
            <br/>
            According to the <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Indeed-Glassdoor-Workplace-Trends-Report-.pdf">‚ÄúIndeed & Glassdoor Hiring and Workplace Trends Report‚Äù</a> for 2023,<br/>
            it states that:<br/>
            <span style="margin-left:50px">‚ÄúCOVID didn't reverse the long-run demographic trends that will drive tight labor<br/></span>
            <span style="margin-left:50px">markets for the next decade, but it did accelerate changes to the workplace.‚Äù</span><br/>
            <br/>
            Granted, this report is in the global scope of employment and not specifically for Ireland, but<br/>
            it did intrigue me as to how exactly we are coping with the after-effects of COVID almost half<br/>
            a decade later.<br/>
            <br/>
            Additionally, LinkedIn's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2025-15-fastest-growing-roles-0q7kc">‚ÄúJobs on the Rise 2025 in Ireland for 2025‚Äù</a> concludes that the majority of<br/>
            growing jobs currently seem to be physical jobs, such as being a Bus Driver, or Facilities<br/>
            Manager, contrary to a likely belief that it would be jobs that you'd work from home at.<br/>
            <br/>
            With all of this information I've gained, I felt it was worthwhile to at least display the<br/>
            fluctuation of employment over the years to show to people visually how the employment<br/>
            levels are performing, and an opinion on whether the government could or should invest in it<br/>
            can be made by each person individually after seeing such.<br/>
            <br/>
            Being able to visualise data is important, so I found, based on the visualisations from CSO<br/>
            and the software <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, that being able to have data be comprehensible in a simple<br/>
            format is always preferable for the end-user. Tableau was able to provide multiple<br/>
            visualisations on the one dashboard, yet still be formatted in such a way that each element<br/>
            is connected in an understandable manner. I'll be taking inspiration from this layout when I<br/>
            create my interface.<br/>

        <h2>üìê Plan and Design</h2>
        <p class="SectionContent">
            The project will be an employment analysis system that collects and visualises employment<br/>
            trends in Ireland, where users will be able to select and filter through data (like by years or<br/>
            gender) to view employment trends. The ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù containing the various graph types<br/>
            that will be created will have data that is <b>cross-referenced together</b>, essentially, comparing<br/>
            employment rates in relation to homelessness rates, to salary rates, hours worked, etc.<br/>
            The use of cross-referencing data is the method I plan to use in order to visualise how<br/>
            employment is interlinked with other elements of Irish society and economy.<br/>
            <br/>
            In order to meet the basic requirements of my project, I plan to use <b>Python</b> to sterilise the<br/>
            data that I will download from the data.cso.ie website as outlined in the brief, and store it in a<br/>
            subfolder so it isn't conflicted with the other source files. To visually display data, I wish to<br/>
            use well-documented libraries such as ‚Äú<b>matplotlib</b>‚Äù in order to create the necessary graphs<br/>
            that fit.  The graphs and information must be encapsulated within a web-based interface,<br/>
            using <b>JavaScript</b>.<br/>
            <br/>
            That being said, web-based content don't directly mix with Python, so in order for the user to<br/>
            directly interact with the graphs and data in real time, and I will be learning how to utilise theL<br/>
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a> library in which I can create an API between the interface and the backend content<br/>
            generated by Python. I also will be able to use the <b>Live Server</b> extension onto <b>Visual<br/>
            Studio Code</b> to watch the webpage update in real time for faster debugging. As a means to<br/>
            create a poll for users, the responses will be stored within an CSV file inside the artefact<br/>
            folder which is sent through the same API.
